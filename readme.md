#Injury Reserve: US Fall Tour 2021 WebMap
##Authored by: Abe Krell
-----
### Purposes:
This interactive web map is based on the fall tour path Phoenix Rap Group 'Injury Reserve' is embarking on, promoting their new album release 'By The Time I Get To Phoenix.'

Some features of this web map include ten stops of the tour, markers at each stop telling the user in which city and venue the show is occurring, a description box with tour dates and openers, additional quotes from the group surrounding the release, a link to their album, a favicon of the album cover, and audio for their leading single 'Knees.'

This map sources information from Injury Reserve themselves, not only for the audio (Self Released, All Rights Reserved) and inspiring style choices of the web map, but for the tour dates as well (https://twitter.com/InjuryReserve/status/1435243483841777667?s=20).  The favicon comes from the album cover for 'By The Time I Get To Phoenix.'
